<!-- # A `.gitkeep` file is a placeholder used in Git to keep empty directories in your repository. Git doesn’t track empty folders, so by adding a `.gitkeep` file inside an empty directory, you can ensure that the directory itself is included when you push your changes. It’s just a way to signal that the directory should be preserved, even if it doesn’t contain any other files. -->
